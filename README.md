# Remote Modulation of Reward Circuits
This repository contains code related to our R21 grant (NIH R21-MH113917). 

## Notes on repository organization and files
- Some of the contents of this repository are not tracked (.gitignore) because the files are large. These files/folders specifically include our dicom images, converted images in bids format, fsl output, and derivatives from bids (e.g., mriqc and fmriprep). All scripts will reference these directories, which are only visible on our the primary linux workstation in Smith Lab.
- Using the BIDS standard for file naming and organization of the primary dataset (ds000000)
- Also using suggestions from BIDS for derivatives and source data
